## Your learning experience for the concept you focused on.
At the beginning of the course, our skill level was at a "modeler" level, and by the end, we progressed to being near "analyst" level. Initially, it was more about "not knowing what we don’t know," but now we’ve reached a stage of "knowing what we don’t know," as Tim illustrated in one of the first lessons.

While we have improved, there is still much to learn, particularly in enhancing our coding skills and exploring the full potential of OpenBIM.

This course introduced us to OpenBIM, and we both believe it has practical applications in our future work. We’ve learned that creating tools not only increases efficiency but also has the potential to streamline processes across various job roles.

## Your process of developing the tutorial
Since this is our first year at DTU, we haven’t thought about it in terms of thesis work yet. However, the process might serve as an alternative or inspiration in the future.

No, having a wide range of options was valuable as it allowed us to brainstorm and focus on what we found interesting. However, the course could benefit from clearer guidance, particularly at the beginning, to help students understand the expectations and get started with coding and software tools. More up-to-date briefings tailored for beginners would be helpful.

The number of tools was sufficient. The assignment structure, particularly Assignment 1 (A1), where we worked in a large group with a manager, was a good idea for helping everyone gain a baseline understanding of the course. However, its effectiveness depended heavily on the manager’s understanding of the course. In our case, it felt like the managers didn’t fully grasp what we were doing, which made the process more challenging. Despite this, we believe the number of tools provided was appropriate.

## (As a group) summary of the feedback you received on your tutorial 
The feedback highlights that our tool effectively addresses the identified use case of helping fire engineers assess fire safety requirements, such as determining the need for specific walls, stairs, or firefighter elevators. It was considered a useful component of a broader fire safety assessment process.

Peers noted that while the tool is useful, more time and data could have been invested to enhance its functionality. Limited knowledge of coding and the subject matter posed challenges in expanding the scope.

The tool was positively received but would benefit from broader regional applicability and further refinement to maximize its utility.

## (Individual) Your future for Advanced use of OpenBIM
Guðný: I am likely to use OpenBIM tool in my thesis. Whether it is a part of my thesis or to check out some measurements. There are a lot of options that can be useful. This can also prevent errors in my thesis.

I see a lot of potential in using OpenBIM tools in my professional life in the next 10 years. In engineering work, there is a lot of checking the same things over and over again in every single project, as no two projects are the same. With OpenBIM, you can create a tool that looks at this specific thing that is being checked and accelerates the process of getting information about the models. OpenBIM can also prevent errors that can occure especially when many areas of work work together.

Noah: 
I haven’t decided on the focus of my thesis yet. I’m planning to take some interesting courses in the fall of 2025 that might help me narrow it down. OpenBIM could be an option, but I’ll decide once I have a clearer idea of what I want to work on.

I think OpenBIM will be really important in the future—it seems like a great way to work more efficiently. I’m planning to work as a design planner at an architecture firm, but I’m not sure how much OpenBIM is used in that specific area right now. From what I’ve learned in this course, though, it feels like something that will be used more and more, especially for things like checking if building regulations are being followed. It seems like a tool worth knowing.

Noah: 
-	A1: At the beginning of A1, we had the opportunity to experiment with Blender and the different IFC models, which helped us realize that coding and getting our scripts to work wasn’t as difficult as we initially thought. However, when it came time to send our code to our managers so they could merge everyone’s work into a report, we encountered some issues. Our code didn’t work as expected, and it was quite challenging to fix. We thought it would work on her computer, but it turned out that we needed a function, not just the same code we wrote in Blender. Nevertheless, it was a good warm-up for A3.

-	A2: In A2, we were required to present the tool we planned to make. This assignment was actually very useful as it forced us to be precise, making it easier to understand what we were working on and to focus on what needed to be done.
  
-	A3: In A3, we had to answer questions about what we had done. It was quite similar to A2, where we described and reported on what had changed from the initial plan, and reflected on problems we encountered along the way. We also discussed things we have done differently from the original plan.
  
-	A4: In A4, we were asked to explain to the user how to use the tool we had created. We chose to do this through a video and a flowchart, which would be easy for the user to follow.
  
-	A5: Now we’re on A5, and during the creation of this assignment, it has sparked thoughts about what I want to do for my thesis and how much I’ve actually learned throughout the course. I’m no longer afraid of programming, and I’ve finally experienced the feeling of having the code understand what I want it to do, which is wonderful.
